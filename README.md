Octome : 
Flavor Text:  A crumbling leather book with seemingly latin script, with messily torn pages.  There is an 8 embossed onto the back.

Effect: When activated, everyone within 8 feet is killed besides the wielder.  In exchange, NO written information can exist about anyone within its radius. This includes past documentation, as well as anything in the future. Text will simply fail to appear on pages as you write it.


Mirror World Effect : When reversed, causes all information hidden by the OCTTOME to be INCREDIBLY EASY to find. People will find themselves drawn to wherever it is, and it will somehow always end up in an easily accessible location.

Plot Consequences:  It being accidentally activated by [REDACTED] is what killed the previous Skunkworks team and erased all records of what cases they'd worked on. A separate accidental activation erased Watt Mark W's harddrive and lead to him being recruited into the Cult of the Nameless One.
