Tres Bottle: 
Flavor Text:  A simple glass milk bottle with a 3 emblazoned on it.

Effect :  If you write a concept on a scrap of paper and stuff it into the bottle, no one *anywhere* but you will be able to remember this exists. This can be as broad as "bananas" or as specific as "what happened the night of this murder".

Mirror World Effect : If you fill the bottle with liquid and dissolve all paper/ink inside then everyone will be aware of the concepts previously contained within it as "general knowledge" (even if they hadn't known about it before).

Plot Consequences:  The Cult of the Nameless One tried to keep Mr Lovettes robbery a sufficient Mystery (despite how much evidence they intentionally left behind) using the Tres Bottle. 

 

The Mirror World uses the Bottle as a means to rapidly disseminate information, propaganda slogans and notices from the Association to its populace.
