Found a Jeffery Lowe. I initially thought it’s a namesake, but all obverse responses are accurate to who I am.

It’s me. What the fuck?

There is a coffee stain, with a light pencil scratch in the center. It better be a practical joke, and whoever is responsible better own up to it.

There are no questions on the reverse. I don’t know what I could have expected.

I asked Clarence, who is the only person who goes to my room anymore, and he called it a very accurate replica. I swear to fucking god if it’s Clarence I am throwing him out of the window.
