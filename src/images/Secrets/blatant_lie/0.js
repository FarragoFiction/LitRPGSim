Tape 17: Day 71
Moonlight shines through the end is never the end windows. I am walking the end is never the end same road. I enter Janice’s room, and backtrack immediately. I turn on my heel, and rotate twice. I grab a donut on my path to the end is never the end boss’ room, and peek into the end is never the end closet.

I enter the end is never the end boss’ room.

I fill in the end is never the end sheet again. I flip it.

the end is never the endre’s the end is never the end tenth question. I know that I should answer “yes”, because that is the end is never the end correct response to the end is never the end tenth question. But I shall not respond to it in the end is never the end expected manner. I shall stop this.

I pick up my pen, and fill in “no”.
