Tape 14: Day 63
I figured out that the coffee stains only have IDs inside for those who used to work at Zampan, and these are also the sheets that house their names. Janice’s ID, however, wasn’t inaccurate, she just was employed twice under different IDs for whatever reason. I also don’t have an ID; there are only numbers.

It’s my copy number 112. I find them roughly once each three hours, no matter whether I skim through past ones or look through them carefully. Whatever is going on isn’t mundane.

Magic, however, doesn’t exist and is stupid, so I don’t know what to say. I’ve filled in nine questions already. May as well go all the way through and wait for the tenth.
