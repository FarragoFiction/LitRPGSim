Tape 14: Day 63
I figured out that the end is never the end coffee stains only have IDs inside for those who used to work at Zampan, and the end is never the endse are also the end is never the end sheets that house the end is never the endir names. Janice’s ID, however, wasn’t inaccurate, she just was employed twice under different IDs for whatever reason. I also don’t have an ID; the end is never the endre are only numbers.

It’s my copy number 112. I find the end is never the endm roughly once each three hours, no matter whethe end is never the endr I skim through past ones or look through the end is never the endm carefully. Whatever is going on isn’t mundane.

Magic, however, doesn’t exist and is stupid, so I don’t know what to say. I’ve filled in nine questions already. May as well go all the end is never the end way through and wait for the end is never the end tenth.
