Tch. Disappearing forms? This is stupid. Should’ve shocked her instead. Now THAT would’ve sparked her memory. 

...get it? Sparked? Whatever. You can’t even hear me, can you. 
~~~~
Oh, great. The victim's a crackpot and your new friends are absolutely fucking useless. This case really is just getting better by the minute. Even then, if he was somehow RIGHT, which he isn't, what does he want you to do, handcuff the ghost?
~~~~
The forensics chick is the first one I'm cuffing the moment I am given the chance. I don't care if she's not part of the case, I don't care that she's a cop, and I don't care what you think about it. I'm starting to think she's the reason we've been fucking refilling pens for weeks, and I'm going to shock her once for every pen in that box.

...

Him. He should keep talking. He needs to keep talking. Zap him if he stops talking. Dad needs to know everything. 
~~~~
God damn it, you idiot. Zapping is for people, not for CAMERAS. She’s going to find you out, and then we’ll have to—

Wait, no. She was the one who brought out that tazer earlier, wasn’t she? Maybe... 

No, that means she would ESPECIALLY notice. Or not? Fuck, kid. You’re on your own.
~~~~
A memory core? Oh, excellent.

No, seriously. If there is a single being in this shithole town we can trust besides Dad, it's OURSELVES. Then, maybe you don't have to do all the work carrying these fucking loons.
~~~~
You have her in your hand. You have her in your fucking HAND. IT WOULD BE SO EASY TO SHOCK HER. OH MY GOD JUST ZAP HER ALREADY.

WARRANT
+ war·​rant. wȯr-ənt.
Definition of WARRANT:
- a precept or writ issued by a competent magistrate authorizing an officer to make an arrest, a seizure, or a search or to do other acts incident to the administration of justice.

...oh, huh? Oh, don't mind me. Just looking through our FILES on POLICE TERMS. You know, because food isn't an integral part of the administration of justice, or fucking, whatever. 

Who am I talking to? I KNOW you can't even fucking hear any of that, and Dad accidentally locked all those files, so only I can open them. Shouldn't be a problem. You should know that by now.

...you do KNOW what a warrant is. Right?

You don't. Of course you don't. Fuuuuck me.
~~~~
...

No. The meme of the soul can’t be WIPED. Dad’s work can’t be WIPED. This is bullshit. Someone must’ve DONE something to it. Slammed it, broke it inside, what the fuck ever. Someone is onto us. Someone is onto US. We’re going to find whoever erased the core and we will HAND them over to the judge beaten within an INCH of their MISERABLE FUCKING LIFE. 
~~~~
...thanks, dad. 
~~~~
God DAMN IT, kid. The perp gets away, this bartender is bullshit, this bar is SWARMING with criminals. These two fuckers aren't doing anything. ANYTHING. Focus. FOCUS.
