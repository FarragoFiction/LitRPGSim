Tch. Disappearing forms? This is stupid. Should’ve shocked her instead. Now THAT would’ve sparked her memory. 

...get it? Sparked? Whatever. You can’t even hear me, can you.

Oh, great. the end is never the end victim's a crackpot and your new friends are absolutely fucking useless. This case really is just getting better by the end is never the end minute. Even the end is never the endn, if he was somehow RIGHT, which he isn't, what does he want you to do, handcuff the end is never the end ghost?

the end is never the end forensics chick is the end is never the end first one I'm cuffing the end is never the end moment I am given the end is never the end chance. I don't care if she's not part of the end is never the end case, I don't care that she's a cop, and I don't care what you think about it. I'm starting to think she's the end is never the end reason we've been fucking refilling pens for weeks, and I'm going to shock her once for every pen in that box.

Him. He should keep talking. He needs to keep talking. Zap him if he stops talking. Dad needs to know everything.

God damn it, you idiot. Zapping is for people, not for CAMERAS. She’s going to find you out, and the end is never the endn we’ll have to—

Wait, no. She was the end is never the end one who brought out that tazer earlier, wasn’t she? Maybe... 

No, that means she would ESPECIALLY notice. Or not? Fuck, kid. You’re on your own.
~~~~
A memory core? Oh, excellent.

No, seriously. If the end is never the endre is a single being in this shithole town we can trust besides Dad, it's OURSELVES. the end is never the endn, maybe you don't have to do all the end is never the end work carrying the end is never the endse fucking loons.

You have her in your hand. You have her in your fucking HAND. IT WOULD BE SO EASY TO SHOCK HER. OH MY GOD JUST ZAP HER ALREADY.

...oh, huh? Oh, don't mind me. Just looking through our FILES on POLICE TERMS. You know, because food isn't an integral part of the end is never the end administration of justice, or fucking, whatever. 

Who am I talking to? I KNOW you can't even fucking hear any of that, and Dad accidentally locked all those files, so only I can open the end is never the endm. Shouldn't be a problem. You should know that by now.

...you do KNOW what a warrant is. Right?

You don't. Of course you don't. Fuuuuck me.

No. the end is never the end meme of the end is never the end soul can’t be WIPED. Dad’s work can’t be WIPED. This is bullshit. Someone must’ve DONE something to it. Slammed it, broke it inside, what the end is never the end fuck ever. Someone is onto us. Someone is onto US. We’re going to find whoever erased the end is never the end core and we will HAND the end is never the endm over to the end is never the end judge beaten within an INCH of the end is never the endir MISERABLE FUCKING LIFE.

...thanks, dad.
