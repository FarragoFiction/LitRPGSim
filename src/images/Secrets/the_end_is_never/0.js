...hey, is this thing on?

I am Jeffery Lowe, an archivist of the Zampan Census Bureau. I am [REDACTED] years old, and as of right now, I am charged with digitizing an old archive.

I don’t like people. They are noisy and nosy. Data isn’t noisy, and neither is it nosy. It doesn’t pry at you with questions. It doesn’t demand time, it only takes it. At least my coworkers understand that I don’t want to be bothered by them, and I don’t bother them in return.

My coworker left for a vacation a week ago. Sometimes they leave emails I have to respond to. I don’t mind that much. At least it’s not in-person.
