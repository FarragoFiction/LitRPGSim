I've been updating the wall again! Yeah, I've put some stuff around… I had to tear some of the old stuff down, though. It was clogging my mind up, you know? Weighing the thoughts down. Getting me distracted. We, we don't need half of them anymore, and they weren't leading anywhere, and it's not like we get that much info on Mr. Cassan anymore, and I needed… I needed to keep all our chores noted down somewhere, and I was gonna miss them if I didn't put them on the wall, so I put them on the wall. Yeah, our stuff is all there. Wib's shifts are actually cataloged now, so he knows when he has to switch shifts with me and when he doesn't, and he actually came up to me yesterday and he pulled me aside! He was like, oh, this is actually pretty convenient Ria, and he had been having problems keeping track, and that he appreciated it, which I thought was crazy, right? Like ‘oh my gosh, he actually thanked me', you know. I mean, you know him, he doesn't really tend to talk to us like that, or really acknowledge that kind of stuff-- really kind of aloof like that, super job-focused, so I was happy to know! I'm really glad he told me.  Especially because I'm not really good at it, so it's not perfect, but, but-- it doesn't have to be? It just works out. I'm glad it helps. 

I don't know what Mil thinks about it though. It's… she's not gonna tell me. I know she's not going to, but it's so hard, you know? I mean, she used to tell me these things, and now she can't, and… I mean, even… back then… she found her way to let me know stuff, like she'd take a bow, or she'd give me a pat, and that last one was weird but at least she was doing the effort of letting me know, like… I knew if she was okay with what I was doing. And now she mostly just gets angry at me, and I'm just like, what did I do wrong, right? I started making this wall because she gave me that job, and then she gets upset when I do it, it's like eggshells. I'm tired of feeling like I have to sidestep her because she won't even try--
