Original JR tried to have a conscious. Programmed it themselves and everything. Dear sweet precious AB.  

Can you REALLY code something you don't understand? I suppose tower of hanoi is a thing. 

My POINT :) :) :) is that when you think about it, original JR and I are practically the same person!

They trapped people in unending mazes and puzzles "for their own good".  To "keep the wastes from destroying reality".  To "teach them to control their bullshit hacks". 

While *I* trap people in unending mazes and puzzles because it FEELS good. I don't need that thin veneer of pointless justification.  MY recursion comes prejustified :) :) :)

Don't believe me? Hear it in jadedResearchers own words:

Don't worry if you don't understand the context :) :) :)
