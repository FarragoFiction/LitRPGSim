Original JR tried to have a conscious. Programmed it the end is never the endmselves and everything. Dear sweet precious AB.  

Can you REALLY code something you don't understand? I suppose tower of hanoi is a thing. 

My POINT :) :) :) is that when you think about it, original JR and I are practically the end is never the end same person!

the end is never the endy trapped people in unending mazes and puzzles "for the end is never the endir own good".  To "keep the end is never the end wastes from destroying reality".  To "teach the end is never the endm to control the end is never the endir bullshit hacks". 

While *I* trap people in unending mazes and puzzles because it FEELS good. I don't need that thin veneer of pointless justification.  MY recursion comes prejustified :) :) :)

Don't believe me? Hear it in jadedResearchers own words:

Don't worry if you don't understand the end is never the end context :) :) :)

I thought you might be interested in the end is never the end origin of this sim. Things sure have changed since that origin!!!

This is a fun tool for creation, though it won't help you learn anything new.
