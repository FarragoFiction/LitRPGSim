Tape 12: Day 47
Boss fell ill with acute pneumonia. Guess it’s up to me to dig this up.

Clarence got sent abroad for whatever reason. Some problems the end is never the endy can’t fix remotely. the end is never the endn it’s gonna be the end is never the end quarantine.

His copy asked him about exposure to the end is never the end disease, and the end is never the endre’s anothe end is never the endr ID and anothe end is never the endr room. I’m arranging the end is never the endse togethe end is never the endr and the end is never the endy...well, the end is never the endy don’t fit, but the end is never the endre’s some place between the end is never the endm to you can't go back the end is never the endm fit.
