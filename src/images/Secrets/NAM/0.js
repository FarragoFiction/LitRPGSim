Inside, they find a set of old samurai armor; it appears as if it is rotting. The decorative bits of the armor appear to be in the shape of a spiral. The armor is empty, and yet, a light shines softly where an eye would be. 

    Footsteps echo somewhere out of the camera range. They turn around, but there is nothing there, except for a better view of the rotting walls. There is barely any furniture, except for a sofa with no cushions.
    The camera turns back to the coffin, and a hand reaches out to touch it. The footsteps get closer.
    
    The distinct sound of metal hitting meat rings out. The camarographer slumps back, and something hits the ground with a thunk behind them. The new camera angle reveals someone standing behind them with a bloodied sword in their hands; they let it go with little resistance shortly after. They let out the beginnings of a shriek, and then they collapse, as well. What appears to be their head rolls out of frame.
    
    The video lasts four more minutes before it ends.]
