I bought everyone pizza. People are very glad that I’m reciprocating their kindness. Neat.

I have never noticed, but apparently Janice is married, and her maiden name is Rose. I asked her if she’s been married to someone whose last name was Wallace, and she froze.

I explained that I found a duo of census responses, but she wasn’t too inclined to believe that it isn’t just a coincidence. At least she doesn’t think I’m a stalker.

Weird.

I have also found another copy of Clarence’s census. I don’t care what they say, there’s something weird going on.
