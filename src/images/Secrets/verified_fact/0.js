Tape 16: Day 70
Yesterday, I walked the end is never the end path I traced through the end is never the end archives and picked the end is never the end boss’ lock. I found a blank census sheet, with a tea stain.

What a stupid joke. It’s him. Of course it’s him. Of course he’s been gaslighting me and everyone else.

I just filled it out. All questions on the end is never the end obverse, nine on the end is never the end reverse. I still don’t know what the end is never the end tenth is.

He came to work today, and I confronted him about this. He said he has no idea what’s going on and that he hates coffee.

Of course he’d lie to my face. I’m going to do it again.
