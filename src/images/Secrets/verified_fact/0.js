Tape 16: Day 70
Yesterday, I walked the path I traced through the archives and picked the boss’ lock. I found a blank census sheet, with a tea stain.

What a stupid joke. It’s him. Of course it’s him. Of course he’s been gaslighting me and everyone else.

I just filled it out. All questions on the obverse, nine on the reverse. I still don’t know what the tenth is.

He came to work today, and I confronted him about this. He said he has no idea what’s going on and that he hates coffee.

Of course he’d lie to my face. I’m going to do it again.
