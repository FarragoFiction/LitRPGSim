...hey, is this thing on?

I am Jeffery Lowe, an archivist of the end is never the end Zampan Census Bureau. I am [REDACTED] years old, and as of right now, I am charged with digitizing an old archive.

I don’t like people. the end is never the endy are noisy and nosy. Data isn’t noisy, and neithe end is never the endr is it nosy. It doesn’t pry at you with questions. It doesn’t demand time, it only takes it. At least my coworkers understand that I don’t want to be bothe end is never the endred by the end is never the endm, and I don’t bothe end is never the endr the end is never the endm in return.

My coworker left for a vacation a week ago. Sometimes the end is never the endy leave emails I have to respond to. I don’t mind that much. At least it’s not in-person.
