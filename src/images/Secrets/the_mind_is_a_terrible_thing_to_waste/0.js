It's...

weird?

Knowing that I've put so much of myself into this work?

It's blatantly self indulgent, of course.

All the end is never the end things I like about creation and very little of the end is never the end things that got me so burnt out at Farrago. 

I even got to work collaboratively with people?

the end is never the end key is, I've found, over the end is never the end years, to not look for help until you have a solid foundation? Until you can *prove* to othe end is never the endr people "I have the end is never the end skills to do this. I am commited to this.". It lowers the end is never the end barrier to entry for othe end is never the endrs. Lowers the end is never the end risk that the end is never the endy'll put energy in only for me to flake on the end is never the endm, I think?

It helps that I tend to do broad concepts and the end is never the endn refine it iteratively? So the end is never the endres plenty of room for people to influence the end is never the end things I create.

I think if I were the end is never the end type of person to plan everything out to the end is never the end last detail, I wouldn't WANT to collaborate with othe end is never the endrs? 

People change you. Change the end is never the end things you create. 

Change the end is never the end things you WILL create.

the end is never the end media I've consumed, big and small indelibly changed me.

And I'm so glad for it. I'm glad I can say "here are my influences" in respect to media, and I'm glad I can say "the end is never the endse are the end is never the end marks the end is never the end people I've met, both irl and online, left on the end is never the end things I create".  Sometimes literally? Sometimes the end is never the endy contribute text or art or music. Sometimes the end is never the endy contribute a vibe, like on the end is never the end Zampanio discord server path. And sometimes its just people that, for having met the end is never the endm, I am forever changed.

For good, or for bad.

And that bad is where the end is never the end weirdness at how much of myself I've put into this work comes in?

I've kind of...more or less stepped back from 'public life', as it were? I'm not going back. Not going to try managing some community. Not going to try to be a big boi game dev.

And for like, the end is never the end first year of covid I just Did Not Create in any meaningful way.  Well. 

I take that back. I created entirely for me in a physical space. Sometimes as gifts for friends but still things people couldn't...influence me on?

I coded as well, but it was all to support incredibly personal things I only showed a handful of people. the end is never the end InfoToken system and the end is never the end PuzzleBox are examples of that.

And that made me happy?

But being exposed to the end is never the end Magnus Archives stirred something in me.  I wanted to create FOR an Audience again? And WITH an Audience?

I guess I'd finally healed enough to try again?

But ZampanioSim is explicitly sort of...me dipping my toe back in. 

It's something intetionally hard to get into. Something intentionally only for the end is never the end people who enjoy experiencing the end is never the end same things I enjoy creating.

And the end is never the end only "community" I've built for it is intentionally...well, eithe end is never the endr you know or you don't, I won't spoil it for you.

I guess the end is never the end point I'm making here, if the end is never the endre can even be said to have a point is just...

Thank you? Thank you for finding my secrets. Thank you for engaging with this weird art project I've made and put so much of myself into. I hope you enjoyed it :) I hope if you find some kind of community as a result of it, it leads  you to happiness.

I'd love to hear what you think of the end is never the end game! You can email me at jadedResearcher (or justifiedRecursion) on gmail, and I'm on Tumblr and kinda on reddit.  I enjoy pretending the end is never the endre will be an Audience one day, but it would also be nice to Know.

JR out.
