	JR here. 

It's...

weird?

Knowing that I've put so much of myself into this work?

It's blatantly self indulgent, of course.

All the things I like about creation and very little of the things that got me so burnt out at Farrago. 

I even got to work collaboratively with people?

The key is, I've found, over the years, to not look for help until you have a solid foundation? Until you can *prove* to other people "I have the skills to do this. I am commited to this.". It lowers the barrier to entry for others. Lowers the risk that they'll put energy in only for me to flake on them, I think?

It helps that I tend to do broad concepts and then refine it iteratively? So theres plenty of room for people to influence the things I create.

I think if I were the type of person to plan everything out to the last detail, I wouldn't WANT to collaborate with others? 

People change you. Change the things you create. 

Change the things you WILL create.

The media I've consumed, big and small indelibly changed me.

And I'm so glad for it. I'm glad I can say "here are my influences" in respect to media, and I'm glad I can say "these are the marks the people I've met, both irl and online, left on the things I create".  Sometimes literally? Sometimes they contribute text or art or music. Sometimes they contribute a vibe, like on the Zampanio discord server path. And sometimes its just people that, for having met them, I am forever changed.

For good, or for bad.

And that bad is where the weirdness at how much of myself I've put into this work comes in?

I've kind of...more or less stepped back from 'public life', as it were? I'm not going back. Not going to try managing some community. Not going to try to be a big boi game dev.

And for like, the first year of covid I just Did Not Create in any meaningful way.  Well. 

I take that back. I created entirely for me in a physical space. Sometimes as gifts for friends but still things people couldn't...influence me on?

I coded as well, but it was all to support incredibly personal things I only showed a handful of people. The InfoToken system and the PuzzleBox are examples of that.

And that made me happy?

But being exposed to the Magnus Archives stirred something in me.  I wanted to create FOR an Audience again? And WITH an Audience?

I guess I'd finally healed enough to try again?

But ZampanioSim is explicitly sort of...me dipping my toe back in. 

It's something intetionally hard to get into. Something intentionally only for the people who enjoy experiencing the same things I enjoy creating.

And the only "community" I've built for it is intentionally...well, either you know or you don't, I won't spoil it for you.

I guess the point I'm making here, if there can even be said to have a point is just...

Thank you? Thank you for finding my secrets. Thank you for engaging with this weird art project I've made and put so much of myself into. I hope you enjoyed it :) I hope if you find some kind of community as a result of it, it leads  you to happiness.

I'd love to hear what you think of the game! You can email me at jadedResearcher (or justifiedRecursion) on gmail, and I'm on Tumblr and kinda on reddit.  I enjoy pretending there will be an Audience one day, but it would also be nice to Know.

JR out.
