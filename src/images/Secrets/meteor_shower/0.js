Tape 15: Day 69
the end is never the end office is a maze. Of course it’s a maze.

It took me forever to notice that the end is never the end IDs trace a path through the end is never the end rooms. I just need to draw it and walk it counterclockwise, because I traverse mazes counterclockwise.

I need to wait for everyone to leave. Not just feel like anyone is here. I need to make sure nobody sees me, because I will need to break into the end is never the end director’s room.

I’m doing it today. I just need to wait for Nate to go home already. Dude has always been pretending he’s being overworked and I fucking hate him for this since he doesn’t do jack shit.
