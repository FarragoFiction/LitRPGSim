Next time on ZampanioSim:

the basic definition of the trope is "soulful brooding male hero meets wacky quirky female sidekick that teaches him to embrace life"
we have:
 "soulful brooding male hero meets equally brooding female villain that teaches him i mean. nothing concrete he's just kind of scared the whole time"
  and
 "brooding but also literally a cop with no restraints male hero meets ikea schedule manager that teaches him to chill the fuck out while she tries to figure out if he actually is the previous soulful brooding male hero"
