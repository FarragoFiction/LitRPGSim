You understand, don't you?


I wonder.

If you're here, there are two possibilities.


Have you already been colonized by Zampanio, and the obsession compels you to dig into this new territory we have discovered?




Or did Lavinraca claim you first, and curiosity leads you here during this the most joyful of months?


Such different possibilities. 



And even then, there remains the question: what led you to them in the first place? Homestuck? Tumblr? House of Leaves? 

And what lead you to those?


All of us are a layer of influences, of colonized ideas and cognitive parasites. 


The Truth within you is different than the Truth within me. 

Yet here we are, in the same place, if not the same time. 


So many ways the layers can stack up to lead to the same result. 


Funny, how minds work, isn't it?
