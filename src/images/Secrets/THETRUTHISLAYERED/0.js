Uh, Week 3. Date is the 5th of July, 1983. This is Researcher Ria, written as R5 of the current Theta Department. This is the daily report on Dev-- I-- I mean, L-O-R4. 

[CLEARS THROAT.]

It has been… a rough couple of days, but it has gotten better from where she first started. She doesn't freak out and starts attacking us at random anymore, and she's started being able to hold… her normal form… again, at least while sleeping. She sleeps a lot still… sixteen hours every day, and then maybe stays awake for eight. We've had to double up on food rations, but she doesn't seem particularly interested in eating meat like we expected, which is… a relief, honestly. As for rehabilitation, she currently responds well to being given social activities, and, uh, just about nothing else? And she does not respond well when we attempt to stop her from hunting. It, uh… it makes her hostile. Very hostile.

I… I've tried tracking down the rando myself, to see if maybe if we just found them she'd calm down again? But the more I stare at the info we have the more I just don't get it. It doesn't make any sense. It's been three weeks. If they didn't mean it, I would've found something already, but it was too clean, you know? The armor won't even let you just shoot someone once. They clearly knew how to get around it, or maybe they didn't, and just lucked out. I can't have that all up for her to see, she'll lose it, but--

Oh, wait. Ending log. She's coming over here.

[STEPPING CAN BE HEARD. IT PROGRESSIVELY GETS LOUDER AND CLOSER.]
