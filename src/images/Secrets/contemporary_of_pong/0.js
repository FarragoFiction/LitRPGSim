Tape 20: Day ???
I clock in at nine in the morning. The air is cool. I just need to finish this archive. There’s only one entry remaining undigitized.

I flip it, and find a coffee stain, with a dotted zero written with a pencil in the center. Sigh. Vandalism.

I copy all there is on the obverse, starting with the name and ending with the occupation. I haven’t met other Jeffery Lowes before. Nice to know you by proxy, namesake. 

I flip it to reverse, where the coffee stain is. Ten questions, ten answers. I fill them in.

Farewell, paper archive. I am finally done with you.
