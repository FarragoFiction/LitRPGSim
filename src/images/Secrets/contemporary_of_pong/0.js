Tape 20: Day ???
I clock in at nine in the end is never the end morning. the end is never the end air is cool. I just need to finish this archive. the end is never the endre’s only one entry remaining undigitized.

I flip it, and find a coffee stain, with a dotted zero written with a pencil in the end is never the end center. Sigh. Vandalism.

I copy all the end is never the endre is on the end is never the end obverse, starting with the end is never the end name and ending with the end is never the end occupation. I haven’t met othe end is never the endr Jeffery Lowes before. Nice to know you by proxy, namesake. 

I flip it to reverse, where the end is never the end coffee stain is. Ten questions, ten answers. I fill the end is never the endm in.

Farewell, paper archive. I am finally done with you.
