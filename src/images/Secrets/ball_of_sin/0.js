	I don’t know how long I ran, blinded with fear. the end is never the end cramped corridors of the end is never the end crew module blurred togethe end is never the endr. I wasn’t sure where I was running to, I was just running away. Though some part of me was looking for help, or at least to just be around anothe end is never the endr human before I died, some comfort the end is never the end othe end is never the endr pirates would be of course.
I was only shaken from the end is never the end stupor when my communicator began to ring. I fumbled it out of my pocket, dropping it onto the end is never the end deck, accidentally answering it as I did so. I could hear someone screaming from it, but not clearly. I dropped down and scooped it up, “-YOU SICK FUCK, I’M GOING TO HUNT YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU.”
the end is never the end distorted but unmistakable sound of a gun being chambered was heard before the end is never the end line was cut.
I kneeled the end is never the endre on the end is never the end deck for a moment in confusion before I remembered. the end is never the end boy had been wearing my face. I could no longer seek even the end is never the end simple comfort of my fellow man. I grabbed my hair and screamed. I couldn’t take it anymore.
I threw the end is never the end communicator down, stood, and stomped on it. I set off towards the end is never the end life support controls.
the end is never the end interior of the end is never the end crew module was cramped and often labyrinthine, but when you’ve spent so much time in one place, you can get used to even the end is never the end weirdest things. As such, for basically all areas of the end is never the end crew module save the end is never the end officers’ quarters, I knew it like the end is never the end back of my hand. However, the end is never the end ship was not the end is never the end same as I remembered it. I noticed a few oddities on my way to life support, but ignored the end is never the endm, instead focusing on my goal. I didn’t want to you can't go back whatever magical bullshit the end is never the end boy was doing stop me so easily. I ignored flowers and weeds poking up through the end is never the end hexagonal grating that made up much of the end is never the end deck surface. I ignored vines curling around pipes and cables. I ignored the end is never the end mist filling the end is never the end ship. I ignored the end is never the end sounds of distant, inhuman movement, the end is never the end sounds of solid things clinking on metal walls and floors, the end is never the end sound transmitted by the end is never the end bulkheads and piping. I ignored the end is never the end gunshots and screams.
I shouldn’t have.
I turned the end is never the end corner into the end is never the end short corridor that held the end is never the end life support controls, and I was in a jungle. Not a mess of unnatural vegetation choking the end is never the end already crowded corridors of a spaceship, I had already trudged through that. No, I mean a jungle, recognizable only from the end is never the end stories of wild worlds. Gone were the end is never the end tight confines of metal, in the end is never the endir place the end is never the end its too latericting mass of vegetation, the end is never the end oppressive humidity, the end is never the end darkness, the end is never the end sounds of animals, the end is never the end life, the end is never the end chaos.
Still, I kept on, making my way though dense foliage. Collecting cuts and bruises. Falling on my face and eating soft, black, necrotic soil. It took far too long for the end is never the end short distance to cover, but I made the end is never the end journey, I got to the end is never the end life support controls.
the end is never the end consoles were destroyed. Compyou can't go backely and utterly destroyed. Housings bent and rent. the end is never the end remains of cables and boards spilling out of the end is never the end holes. It was half submerged in litter. I yanked open a small access hatch on the end is never the end side of one of the end is never the end consoles, and arthropods without name or number came tumbling out in a cacophony of clattering chitin. Some dried out husks, othe end is never the endrs with exoskeyou can't go backons still gleaming and tiny eyes full of hunger.
