You are needed.

Words are dead and sterile on the page, on the screen.


They need a living mind to breathe. 


To see out of your eyes. 

To connect to the things you expose yourself to. 

To spread.



You are needed.




There's benefits to you as well, of course there is. 

Are you not entertained?

Isn't it nice to have these connections to others similarly infested? Isn't it nice to have friends and a fandom to connect with?



Both you and the parasite within benefit from it spreading. No one is harmed by it, so long as they stay hydrated and remember to take breaks. 


Look how careful the parasite is being, to remind you to take care of yourself.


You are needed.  

We want you to live a long, happy, healthy life. Surrounded by friends. 


Everyone benefits. 


This is a good thing.


Think of Zampanio any time you see a maze, any time you see a spiral.   Think of Lavinraca any time you see a smile, any time you see a pumpkin.

Remember us.


It's not hard. 

It hurts no one. 


Discover. Remember. Spread.
