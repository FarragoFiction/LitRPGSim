begin with and the dense maze of aluminum did odd things to the sound. I had walked down to long corridors that had apparently went nowhere only for me to find they led to a single cabin by going around it. I was just deciding to turn back and return to my hiding spot when I got to an intersection of corridors and turned a corner.
There, with a completely different demeanor, was the boy. Instead of childish, or imposing, he stood in the middle of the narrow corridor appearing amused, satisfied. He was leaning against the bulkhead, picking his teeth then cleaning out under his nails, flicking the debris against the opposite bulkhead, all the time with a massive grin on his face. I was frozen in place, I watched him for several moments as he hummed to himself. I noticed that the flecks he was flicking away were red, there was a small group of red dots forming on the bulkhead. One impacted with a barely audible splatter as another began to drip down the wall. He looked up at me then, despite my best efforts his eyes locked with mine. He giggled at me.
I stumbled backwards in terror. I couldn’t stop the urge to run that time, it was too great. So I stumbled backwards through the corridor until I tripped over the threshold of a hatch and into the officer’s mess, which was more of a small lounge. Another pirate broke my fall and swore at me for it. I quickly righted myself and looked around, the cabin was full of men, most of them craning to get a look down a corridor through a hatch on the opposite side of the cabin. I rapidly looked back to the corridor I had come from, but the boy was nowhere to be seen.
The guy I had stumbled into asked what was wrong with me. I asked him what had happened.
He answered, “Well it’s hard to tell with all these assholes in the way, but from what I’ve heard the captain was found dead in his cabin, brutally murdered by the sound of it.”
“The boy”, I whispered in shock.
He laughed, “You think the little kid the captain dragged aboard would be able to overpower and murder him? Unless of course you’re suggestin;laksjdf;alsjd;alskjfd
The conversation of all the pirates in the lounge carried on. I barely heard any of it. My face flushed and my ears whined, filling with white noise, filling with my racing thoughts. Through the buzz I heard snatches of the surrounding conversations.
     	“Ahahaha, can you believe what that dumbass over there said?”
        	“Do you really believe what some of these idiots are on about?”
        	“I heard he was ripped limb from limb.”
        	“They found his guts on the ceiling.”
        	“Everyone is a suspect.”
        	“Well, the boy was the last one with the Captain…”
        	“Don’t be fucking ridiculous.”
        	I lurched around for a few seconds, eventually finding a bulkhead to lean against. I fished my communicator out of a jumpsuit pocket and checked the time. I had been napping in life support for a couple of hours. It would be many more before the ship left warp.
