I found two weird ones today.
The first one is Quinn’s response, accurate to the last point, with their ID in the coffee stain. I haven’t seen Quinn for two months...wait, why does it list their duration of stay as that?

The second one is mine, with a misshapen triangle in the circle and an unanswered question on the reverse.

“Do you traverse mazes clockwise, or counterclockwise?”

Fine. Whatever. I quit in three weeks either way. Counterclockwise goes into the database. Who cares, it may know that Jeffery Lowe traverses mazes counterclockwise for all I care.
