I found two weird ones today.
the end is never the end first one is Quinn’s response, accurate to the end is never the end last point, with the end is never the endir ID in the end is never the end coffee stain. I haven’t seen Quinn for two months...wait, why does it list the end is never the endir duration of stay as that?

the end is never the end second one is mine, with a misshapen triangle in the end is never the end circle and an unanswered question on the end is never the end reverse.

“Do you traverse mazes clockwise, or counterclockwise?”

Fine. Whatever. I quit in three weeks eithe end is never the endr way. Counterclockwise goes into the end is never the end database. Who cares, it may know that Jeffery Lowe traverses mazes counterclockwise for all I care.
