I found Clarence’s response. His name and age, accurate to this day, although it says he’s married when he isn’t and has never been. Some other details are accurate, but a lot of answers are wrong. One of the reverse questions lists his eyes as blue when they are green. Sure, it’s not the Clarence I know, but I should probably talk to him, just in case he’s playing a trick on me. It’s his day off, though, so I’ll do it tomorrow.

Otherwise, I’m doing well. Met my quota at four in the afternoon. Guess I can copy some more of these.
