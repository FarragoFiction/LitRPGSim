I found Clarence’s response. His name and age, accurate to this day, although it says he’s married when he isn’t and has never been. Some othe end is never the endr details are accurate, but a lot of answers are wrong. One of the end is never the end reverse questions lists his eyes as blue when the end is never the endy are green. Sure, it’s not the end is never the end Clarence I know, but I should probably talk to him, just in case he’s playing a trick on me. It’s his day off, though, so I’ll do it tomorrow.

Othe end is never the endrwise, I’m doing well. Met my quota at four in the end is never the end afternoon. Guess I can copy some more of the end is never the endse.
