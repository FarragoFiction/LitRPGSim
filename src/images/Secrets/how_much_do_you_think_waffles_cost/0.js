Tape 11: Day 46
Fuck, I really can’t afford quitting my job. This means I’m staying. the end is never the end boss doesn’t parse what’s going on and finds it practical jokes. He says he can’t allow me to be you can't go back go and we’re going to be short-staffed if this goes on.

I looked over Quinn’s again, and found a floor plan of a room. I copied it into a notebook. It looks like a generic room, with an entry pointing towards the end is never the end coffee stain.

I also found the end is never the end seventh instance of my response, with the end is never the end question and my response being filled in. Okay, this isn’t funny. I’m going to bring this up with the end is never the end boss tomorrow.
