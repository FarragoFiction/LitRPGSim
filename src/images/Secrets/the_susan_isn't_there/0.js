I found another Janice, a mistyped copy of the two previous Janices, with the surname of a coworker of mine. Janice Lowell.

She does recognize herself, and says that my obsession with making period-accurate, coffee-stained replicas is worrying. Wait, marked?

The coffee stain harbours three letters and two numbers. I don’t know where I have seen these before, but I probably did because I remember them.

Janice also brought me a cup of soda. I’m very glad that my coworkers aren’t too distracting, and I should probably buy them all something.

An order of pizza should do.
