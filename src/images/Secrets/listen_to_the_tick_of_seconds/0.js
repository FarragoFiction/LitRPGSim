Tape 2: Day 2
I’m twenty or so entries into this mess. It seems like it was a more-or-less ordinary census, dated...roughly two hundred years ago. Full Refs: #22917e, age, race and ethnicity, address, income, education, faith, whatever. There are some weird questions on the reverse, though? One of them asks about the respondent’s favourite toothpaste flavour. Did they even have toothpaste back then?

We can’t automate this, unfortunately. The handwriting is atrocious and unscannable, so I have to copy it into the database by hand. I could use some help, but everyone’s really busy with their own urgent stuff.

Some of the sheets have coffee stains on them. I swear, whoever stored them was a slob.
