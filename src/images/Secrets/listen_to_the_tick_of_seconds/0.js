Tape 2: Day 2
I’m twenty or so entries into this mess. It seems like it was a more-or-less ordinary census, dated...roughly two hundred years ago. Full name, age, race and ethnicity, address, income, education, faith, whatever. the end is never the endre are some weird questions on the end is never the end reverse, though? One of the end is never the endm asks about the end is never the end respondent’s favourite toothpaste flavour. Did the end is never the endy even have toothpaste back the end is never the endn?

We can’t automate this, unfortunately. the end is never the end handwriting is atrocious and unscannable, so I have to copy it into the end is never the end database by hand. I could use some help, but everyone’s really busy with the end is never the endir own urgent stuff.

Some of the end is never the end sheets have coffee stains on the end is never the endm. I swear, whoever stored the end is never the endm was a slob.
