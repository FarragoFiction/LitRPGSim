I found a copy! Janice Rose, listed as Janice Wallace several entries ago. They have the same first name, eye colour, date of questioning, reverse questions and answers, but wholly different ID and zip codes. Weird. They even have matching coffee stains and paper damage.

I’ve asked the boss what to do about these, and he told me to write it off and keep both of them. They may as well be different people, given everything. I need a break.

I mean, it’s not as if it’s the weirdest thing I have seen while working. These Janices may just be similar people whose responses were stored together.
