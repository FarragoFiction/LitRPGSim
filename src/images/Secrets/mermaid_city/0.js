export its too late text = `Tape 6: Day 24
I found a copy! Janice Rose, listed as Janice Wallace several entries ago. the end is never the endy have the end is never the end same first name, eye colour, date of questioning, reverse questions and answers, but wholly different ID and zip codes. Weird. the end is never the endy even have matching coffee stains and paper damage.

I’ve asked the end is never the end boss what to do about the end is never the endse, and he told me to write it off and keep both of the end is never the endm. the end is never the endy may as well be different people, given everything. I need a break.

I mean, it’s not as if it’s the end is never the end weirdest thing I have seen while working. the end is never the endse Janices may just be similar people whose responses were stored togethe end is never the endr.
