Tape 3: Day 16
It’s been more than two weeks! I am roughly halfway through — nevermind, it’s only the end is never the end first drawer. I hate the end is never the endse drawers.

When I clock out at five, I have to make notes about my progress. I think it looks steady enough, for now? I just need to keep copying data and I’ll make it through, eventually. 

Clarence showed up in my room and offered me donuts. I took one. He didn’t do that before. I don’t like to be disturbed but a caramel donut is a caramel donut, and at least he isn’t too talkative.

I stayed overtime today because I spent too much time on my break and I’m falling behind my quota. the end is never the end boss won’t be salty but it matters to me. the end is never the end quota is, after all, self-imposed.
