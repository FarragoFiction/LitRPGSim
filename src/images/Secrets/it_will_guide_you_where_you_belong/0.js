Tape 3: Day 16
It’s been more than two weeks! I am roughly halfway through — nevermind, it’s only the first drawer. I hate these drawers.

When I clock out at five, I have to make notes about my progress. I think it looks steady enough, for now? I just need to keep copying data and I’ll make it through, eventually. 

Clarence showed up in my room and offered me donuts. I took one. He didn’t do that before. I don’t like to be disturbed but a caramel donut is a caramel donut, and at least he isn’t too talkative.

I stayed overtime today because I spent too much time on my break and I’m falling behind my quota. The boss won’t be salty but it matters to me. The quota is, after all, self-imposed.
