//but JR can't people just get into these passwords without finding them "the right way"?
//bold of you to assume that THIS isn't the right way and all other ways are cheating
//hack my shit
//i dare you
//if you want to SHOW UP then what you do is figure out where these passwords are leaked :) :) :)
//if anyone can explain the origin of each one you'll unlock secret content directly from me
//hell, if you can even do a majority I'd love to hear it, in all sincerity. I love hearing people find my work interesting :)


//look, okay, al bhed from ffx is something that for *some* percent of the population feels in their bones
//so this will drive home a nagging sense of familiarity, that it MUST be important
//at the same time when you look at it in writing it's gibberish
//but when you hear it spoken it flirts with being just phonetic english with an accent
//it vibes perfectly with the sense of misleading truths and lies with a core of truth
