      TRUTH.

        <li>JR, walking around</li>
        <li>footstep sounds</li>
        <li>always scroll to top of present car in new room</li>
        <li>eyes are real so mirrors are real.(extra empty room with transparent mirror, but a second jr behind it) after car 13 a mirror is built into the walls, jr can see themself in it, and think about themself</li>
        <li>In each car is a single object. Investigating it gives you my surface thoughts on it.</li>
        <li>In Layer 2, Truth the character discusses the object as well on a philosophical level.</li>
        <li>In Layer 3 (console), I mention my coding thoughts.</li>
        <li>In Each Car, reveal one Truth, at random. (examples, why things are in React not dart, the nature of the maze that is the code base, my experience with corporate life, the sources of various characters)</li>
        <li>You can move backwards to revisit previous Truths, but the Rot is coming.</li>
        <li>In addition to corrupting the room, the Rot does a RotX cipher on it. For nearly no reason other than to make things harder on everyone. Code rot makes it harder and harder to debug wigglersim</li>

* train car object has: 
    * central object
    (rot is NOT part of it, its true random. the rot of chaos)
* in the center of each room is an object, stored in ZampanioHotlink
* if jr walks up to the object, you get: 
     * jr within's surface thoughts on it as a thought bubble
     * truth's "thoughts" on it in the background
     * jr-who-was-coding's thoughts on it in the console
     * jr-who-found-the-object's thoughts in the EmbeddedSource
* if you go too far backwards the Rot sets in
      </ul>
