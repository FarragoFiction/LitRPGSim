/*
do i want a menu item thats just a mini game, like an idle thing?

or a text based adventure stuck in JUST TRUTH mode?
*/

//LORE, BACKSTORY and QUESTS should grab from theme  mix and match templates that have things to fill
// in mad lib style (noun, adj, object, etc) and then have little frame parts that make things work
//like "long long ago".
/*
To make a new menu you need to tie it in two places in the MENU, make its typescript file ,
make its observerbot level
and also wire the first time you go there into the achievement system
(and also possibly the levels of the menu);
