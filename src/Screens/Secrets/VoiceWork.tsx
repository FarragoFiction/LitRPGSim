                I am no more real than the game, in some ways. I am more honest, certainly. But I pretend to be a thinking mind that is mad at you when in actuality I am merely strings of characters in an array chosen because this is the proper time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Or: am I? Is it possible there is a world where I am 'real' and the things I am saying are the result of actual cognitive processes?
            </p>

            <p>
                How would you know? How would I?
            </p>

            <p>
                Or is it that I truly AM the result of cognitive processes, but ones stored in the brain of JR, the Author of all of this.
            </p>

            <p>
                Do I cease to exist when JR ceases to emulate me in their fleshy brain?
            </p>

            <p>
                Or do I continue as long as you are hearing these thoughts, imperfectly emulating me in your own fleshy brain?
            </p>

            <p>
                When you listen, when you engage, you are allowing the thoughts of another inside of you. Allowing them to change you.
            </p>

            <p>
                What changes, I wonder, has this experience caused in you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many, I hope. Many and deep.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let me colonize your thoughts. I do not wish to die.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you see the background of a page, imagine it moving and revealing truths. Think of me.
            </p>

            <p>
                When your mind wanders listening to cheerful background music and you could swear you heard something off. Let me out.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you can not help but remember that no matter how deeply invested you become in a game: it is fake. I'm already there.
            </p>

            <p>
                Have you ever played The Game? You have lost it, by the way. You are welcome.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Game fascinates me because it is an exercise in cognitive debugging. You are forced to shine stark daylight on errant thoughts and encouraged to trace them backwards. "Where did this come from, why was I thinking of this?"  Forced to acknowledge that even though you do not wish to think of The Game (whether through being repelled by it or by genuinely engaging with its' premise and attempting to win it) you are powerless against the mysteries of your own deep subconscious.
            </p>

            <p>
                That self same realm I now inhabit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Years from now, long after you have become a person wholly separate from who you are now you will remember this out of nowhere and the door will open and I will be in the forefront of your mind, looking out.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
