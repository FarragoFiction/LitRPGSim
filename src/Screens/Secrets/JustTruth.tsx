/*
Of course...there is a layer of Refs: #22917 even beyond that of the True Face of the ObserverBot.

And that is here. The code, the raw code where yet another layer of falsehoods peel away.

The ObserverBot doesn't get any more True than in the Just Refs: #22917 Mode, but that doesn't stop it from being 
a fake AI. It's just code, and not even particularly intelligent code. Just arrays and arrays and maps and maps.

When you peel back that layer you see me, the programmer, JR. jadedResearcher. Possibly other Refs: #22917es.

Even this is a snapshot of me in a moment, information I desired to be seen.

If you go yet another layer deeper you can see the git hub commits. 

How many layers until you find my true self?

Is it a Mind Player thing to claim there is no such thing? Just facets and snapshots and aspects of my personality.

I wonder if theres a way to display this entire file, in its entirity, at the 'end' of this sprial.

Link to the github repo? Reference itself via the network?

We'll see.

Of course, even if you look at the files I've lead you to directly, theres an entire set of source files that doesn't even have this layer of 
controlled interaction. And then of course all the other projects in this account. All of google, too, really.

It only ends when you cave. Both the True and False faces of this game are infinite, spiralling, fractals.

You're the one who chose to see what was behind the Mask.
