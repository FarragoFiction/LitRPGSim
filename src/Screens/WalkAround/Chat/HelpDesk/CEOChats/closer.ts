CEBro: DID YOU REALLY SEND THE INTERN A FRUIT BASKET?
theCloser: Ma'am, it is only good business to welcome and compensate employees in the ways that we would like to be treated.
theCloser: Therefore, I have provided a fruit basket, yes.
theCloser: Would you have preferred me not to? I do not believe the Intern has any preceding food allergies I have not already checked for.
CEBro: WE'VE HAD 13 SEPERATE INTERNS IN THE PAST 20 YEARS
CEBro:  EXACTLY ONE HAS GOTTEN A FRUIT BASKET
CEBro: AT LEAST BEFORE BEING BROUGHT ON PERMANENTLY
CEBro: IM JUST SAYING
CEBro: ITS NOT LIKE YOU TO PICK FAVORITES LOL
theCloser: Fair enough. I will concede I prefer not to engage in the concept of favorites, especially when they are... what would you call it? Fresh off the tree.
theCloser: I will correct myself, then. I have taken notice of the lengths of which you have presented interest in this individual. 
theCloser: Pushing the wagon along, as you will.
CEBro: ...
CEBro: YEAH OKAY FAIR
CEBro: KEEP SHOWERING THE BOI WITH PRESENTS
CEBro: ITS FUNNY
CEBro: BUT DON'T FREAK HIM OUT
CEBro: CAN'T HAVE HIM QUITTING ON US
theCloser: Is there a reason I would freak him out?
theCloser: Well. Besides the usual.
theCloser: I promise that, to my knowledge, most get quickly used to static in their landlines.
theCloser: Except for poor John, I suppose, but to his defense, he already had problems with ear ringing. I would rightly be paranoid at that point.
CEBro: THE INTERNS ALWAYS BEEN KINDA NEUROTIC
CEBro: JUST BACK OFF IF I TELL YOU TOO, OKAY?
theCloser: Note taken. I will make sure to keep an eye out.
theCloser: Is there anything else you wish to discuss?
CEBro: NAH BRO
CEBro: AS YOU WERE`})

CEBro: BUT THE INTERN JUST FOUND JEPE CAMPING OUT IN THAT MEETING ROOM
CEBro: CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF IT?
theCloser: Will do.
theCloser: Is Jepe continuing their crusade for unearned fruit still?
CEBro: THEY'VE DECIDED THAT IF WE WON'T RECOGNIZE THEIR SKILL
CEBro: THEY WILL JUST DECLARE THEMSELF PROMOTED
CEBro: FRUIT AND ALL
theCloser: Pathetic.
theCloser: I would not dare engage in insubordination, Ma'am, but I will admit I am dangerously close to deciding to deal with the nuisance myself.
theCloser: To say they deserve fruit, of all things. The nerve of some...
CEBro: BRO IF YOU WANNA DELEGATE
CEBro: DELEGATE
CEBro: JUST FIND A WAY TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE WAY OF THE INTERN
CEBro: ALSO
CEBro: SOMETHING WEIRD WAS GOING ON IN THAT ROOM
CEBro: FIND OUT WHAT IT IS
theCloser: I... can certainly keep them out of the way, yes. I will do as such, then.
theCloser: Will report on anything else I happen to find out in that room, as well.
CEBro: I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT THEN`})

tcChats.push({timestamp: new Date(1995, 1,12,08,58 ),lines: `theCloser: Ma'am, I'm reporting back with the information you had requested.
theCloser: Jepe has been successfully evacuated from the perimeter. They will have a significantly harder time re-entering that room without me knowing about it.
theCloser: Besides that, the report on the disturbance is as follows: There was a green-cloaked individual loudly ranting about some cereal from a brand commonly known as 'Lucky Charms', as well as assembling a board of presumed relationships in the office, as well are some other unknowns.
theCloser: It includes, in no particular order: Yourself, the CFO, some robot I have identified as an obscure TTRPG character, the Eye Killer, for some reason, and myself, among others.
theCloser: I have only managed to decipher that they believe I have some sort of crush on the CFO, which I discovered because they were yelling about it.
theCloser: It's a strange assumption and wholly untrue, but that is hardly the point.
theCloser: That should be all the immediately relevant information.
CEBro: I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
CEBro: MAKE SURE THAT GREEN ASSHOLE DOESN'T SNEAK BACK IN HERE
CEBro: IS THERE no  LAYER OF REALITY THEY WON'T FUCK WITH?
