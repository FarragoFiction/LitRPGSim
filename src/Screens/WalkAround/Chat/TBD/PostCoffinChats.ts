theBestDude72: okay.
theBestDude72: let me set the stage for you.
theBestDude72: i was browsing the 'net.
theBestDude72: going down some link holes, you know?
theBestDude72: when i find this weird puzzle.
theBestDude72: and it makes me think of how much you'd like it?
theBestDude72: so i decide to check it out, to like, see if i could recommend it to you?
theBestDude72: and before I know it i'm sucked in?
theBestDude72: i'm not normally one to get all obessed with puzzles but...
theBestDude72: this one caught me...
theBestDude72: it's like it was exactly the right difficulty? 
theBestDude72: i never got frustrated and gave up.
theBestDude72: and then before i know it, i'm at the end?
theBestDude72: and it leads to a instant messaging account.
theBestDude72: so i message it.
theBestDude72: of course i do.
theBestDude72: gotta let you know if it has a satisfying ending.
theBestDude72: and the account messages me BACK.
theBestDude72: so OBVIOUSLY its a bot, right?
theBestDude72: so i start messing with it a bit.
theBestDude72: trying out some key phrases, see if i can't get the next step in the puzzle.
theBestDude72: and the bot is CRAZY responsive, just joking back and forth with me.
theBestDude72: and eventually it dawns on me that theres no way this is a bot?
theBestDude72: but by then i'm just having fun talking to this rando.
theBestDude72: i'd forgotten how nice it feels to just have a normal conversation.
theBestDude72: and the guy is hilarious, you'd love him.
theBestDude72: but yeah...
theBestDude72: apparently he made the puzzles?
theBestDude72: he has this entire elaborate joke about being the CEO of Eyedol Games.
theBestDude72: says he'll hook me up with a job.
theBestDude72: i'm half tempted to call his bluff and just...
theBestDude72: show up at the HQ, all eager to work or whatever it is people do at office jobs.
theBestDude72: if it was you, you'd do it, right?
theBestDude72: go the extra mile for a laugh and to get more info...`})
