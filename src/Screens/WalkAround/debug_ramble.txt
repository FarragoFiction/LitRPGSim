Alright what do I need to do next?

I want to be able to take a CustomerServiceRamble and generate the next extension you need to call from it.

The next extension should have a number, a title,a ramble, and...

hrm. so directory should actually link to a CustomerSupporSpecialist.

and i don't need to generate that in the ramble itself, instead replace anything like a scripting language with the next person


a benefit of this is that EACH time you call back to the same guy they send you somewhere else. 

because customer service is hell in both directions.
