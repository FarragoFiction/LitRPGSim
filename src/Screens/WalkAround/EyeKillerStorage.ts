`It's hard, crawling around the vents. It’s hard, and nobody understands.

You hear a lot of things in the vents. It’s why you carry around your tapes: to keep it all in, and close, and safe. Very safe. Safe with you.

Around here, it’s different, though. These rooms. So many things want to see you. That wanderer. Those lidless eyes. Even those roamers from the West.

The voice in your best friend’s head says it doesn’t exist. You keep it all recorded, though. A mirror stolen on one, a pot roast gone the next. The paint drying room. Rooms moving, changing. 

One says they’d crawl onto your vents, and pretend to be a wild animal.

Saying is not the same as doing, though. 

You welcome them to try.`
