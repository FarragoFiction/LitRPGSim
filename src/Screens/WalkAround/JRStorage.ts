`How long... have you been here?

That question has an alarmingly low Relevance quotient, but it comes up just the same. You wonder if it's been watching the unmarked, or assembling these shipping grids that has brought up the question in you.

You don't immediately remember WHAT you know, in a more basic primal sense. Puzzles, animorphs, sure. But... before? Really, you have to make do with what you find. there are so many interesting things, like these charms, which so perfectly encapsulate your enjoyment of gigglesnort, even if you don't recall where the word came from aside from what must not be named. It's hard to remember any customs. But you do know...

You came from Earth. Right. Something about it makes your notFace curl up tightly on itself; a tinge of uncertainty about the whole thing washing over it all. Like when a file isn't where you expect it to be, or when the operating system changes its logo to something more... simplified. More stripped of nuance.

Well, that makes two of you, doesn't it? So it's not like it MATTERS. You have MUCH more important things to do, anyway. 

These mazes don't build themselves, after all.`
