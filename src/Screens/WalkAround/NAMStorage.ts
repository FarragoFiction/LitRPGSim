That word lingers at the tip of your tongue, in the back of your mind. 

You swear it nearly leaves your mouth, sometimes. In the roots of the potted plant near the kitchen; in the threads of some stray gold wires. In the fruit that the Closer hoards so mercilessly, and the Flower Chick’s long coat. In Tyrfing’s glare, intent with resolution. In the Killer’s strange insistence of taking you, and you alone. 

A spark of something, just waiting to be tapped into. Just waiting for you to remember.

It chokes you up just thinking about it, in ways a ghost shouldn’t and a robot couldn’t. For a second, you exhale in a way you haven’t felt before. Not a staged breath, no. This is no simulation. Something real.

What was it?

Why can’t you remember?`

    Really, the plot did him dirty. The world did you dirty as well, but that was because the heroes… well. What are navis but tools, anyway? They would’ve gone to hell and back to rescue their precious Garnett. 
    
    Well, actually, yes, they did go to hell and back. That was the last time you met. Not that you weren’t expecting it, of course. They are… highly predictable, in a way that you hope you are not. 
    
    You could’ve made short work of them. You had Yggdrasil, and they had nothing but a lifeless copy of their old operator. You could’ve stopped them. They only lived, because you, you...
    
    It doesn’t matter. Truth knows how the story goes. No use in repeating it. But oh, how the tables have turned. 
    
    This is not the Watt you came here with. No, not at all. Your Watt wasn’t this unsure-- at least, not anymore-- and he certainly wasn’t so transparent, in both ways of the word. He’s a copy, that’s for sure.
    
    And yet, you’re happy to see him. It’s almost like he’s…
    
    Endearing.
    
    Yeah. You could watch him for just a bit more. If only for that tiebreaker.`
