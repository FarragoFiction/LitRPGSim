`Questions. 

It was easy to tire of questions. Those around her had asked many of her, as some did before, and would do as well. Why focus on commerce? Why dedicate so much time to the art of the transaction?

It’s elementary: value is eternal. In the world, there are wants, and there are needs; the strings that tug at these basic concepts had been sewn since before you were born. All you’ve ever wanted to do was master it, and truly, why wouldn’t you? 

At first, it was merely a fleeting curiosity, a whim in your developing mind. Then, it became a hobby. Then, a profession, and matters worked themselves out, for a while. But then the world faltered. Your so-called friends ripped whatever contentment you had left. That lasting pride morphed into feverish hunger, and you ate; you consumed all that surrounded you, friend and foe, beast or man, until… well, it was all drained out. Until there were no more lands to settle. Until your world became no more. 

It took a lot out of you to get where you are, and you bear the scars to prove it. In fact, they’re all over your body; every limb, every inch, all fuzzy, like looking through squinted eyes. Some would find it tragic. No one would ever come to recognize you ever again.

The facsimile of your lips curl into a smile.

Good.`
