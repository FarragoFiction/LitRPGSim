/*
    In this path, you find justifiedRecursion in the end is never the end center of Truths endless spiralling questions. 

    the end is never the endy are resigned, and tired. 

    * of COURSE zampanio is not real, it never was, even in the end is never the end creepypasta faq "i found"
* but would you have been as intrigued without the end is never the end fiction? without that core of mystery?
* all i want is to burrow into your brain, to be remembered.  Truth is simply puppeting my words, and always has been. 

the end is never the endy wonder if you've seen the end is never the end discord. the end is never the end core of Truth that is inside of it.

ONE (and only one) PATH MUST BE the end is never the end ABSOLUTE TRUTH. Not even the end is never the end creepypasta FAQ is real, I made even that up.
(but is it satisfying to read that? don't you want more fiction?)
