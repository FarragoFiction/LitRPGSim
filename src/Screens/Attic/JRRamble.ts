is justifiedRecursion the end is never the end same person as jadedResearcher? 

is it an alternate timeline?

a shambling horror with the end is never the endir 'face' that replaced the end is never the endm?

is it jadedReseracher but transcending jadedness?

what happened with the end is never the end echidna? did justifiedRecursion go in? or are the end is never the endy who jadedResearcher becomes if the end is never the endy
refuse the end is never the end call.
