[audible scoff] And then, there’s this one. 

Perhaps it is that I’ve grown annoyed with the constant inconveniences this one likes to cause, feuding with Tyrfing, and whatnot. But… no, nevermind, it is that I’ve gotten annoyed. See, when I had first called her, I thought I was dealing with a fellow professional in her own strange way. She was not what we would call a talker, but she certainly was efficient at what she did. What I had not considered was the idea that I was negotiating with some irreverent mime incapable of understanding work as anything more than a circus performance.

I, for one, am tired of it. There is much more important work to be done, that we are doing, while she spends her time strapping the others to poles, or making letters out of newspaper articles, or pretending to not be able to speak, or leaving tape recordings on my exposition booth along with someone’s eyeballs, which I’m starting to amass an irresponsible amount of. How am I supposed to dispose of these? I let the flower girl take some of the tapes, but as far as I’m aware, she’s just tossing them into the room with the door that eats. Apparently it is “not a big fan of spheres”, whatever that means.

Not that it matters, of course. No one here can actually die, anyway. She’s bound to tire eventually, which I’m assuming is what got her here. That, or the fact that it seems everyone here helped to propagate this branch in some way, which… Well, that is a bothersome thought. Log over.
