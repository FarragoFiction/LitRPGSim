Well, this one should be interesting. The viking has an enormous chip on his shoulder; it’s one that not even death has managed to rip out of him. 

Interesting that I missed him on the way here. You could consider us… well, ‘neighbors’. Coworkers, really, if in different subsidiaries. From what I understand, his labor involved being an enforcer of sorts, with it involving those strange babies that follow him around. He hardly seems like he knows what Zampanio is outside of something he keeps calling ‘the great work’. Well, whatever it is, it’s what has fueled him all this time. I suppose the seed was planted in his subconscious in a different way than the others… curious.
    
However, it does not take the keen eye of an analyst to figure out that he is definitely compensating for something. Not that I’ll complain: that bravado of his is very useful when something needs to be taken care of, but I’m not convinced that a man that does nothing but code simulations about eternal battle and has a body count consisting entirely of babies is someone who is actually capable of carrying that duty to its fullest extent. But I don’t call the shots-- around here, at least. Truth knows why he’s here.
