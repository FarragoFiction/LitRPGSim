Dear diary,
<Br><br>
I believe that perhaps I have failed to mention some other inhabitants of this maze. I suppose it didn’t matter at first, considering the sheer size of it all. Would you spend every second examining all the corners of this place? Well, I suppose if you’re that person, you might, but that hardly seems time-efficient. 
<br><br>
So, this is that list. The mouth that eats is certainly very voracious. The other inhabitants seem nice enough, but vampire rules: have to be invited first, which… sucks. The train conductor I don’t understand the intentions of, but good for them. And that other girl… Why would I say anything about her, in any capacity? I know I have an incredibly obvious crush on her copy that I won’t shut up about, and that I keep hiding from everyone even though no one thinks I’m anything else other than an incredibly hopeless bisexual, but a girl has to know to differentiate, you know? In fact, maybe she’s not even that bad. Maybe I’d like her to grab me by the static collar and teach me some accounting tips herse--
<br><br>
[beat] Oh, there she is. [beat] Oh, she’s not going to be too happy about this, is she? [chuckles] Well, I’m going to start running now. Bye.
