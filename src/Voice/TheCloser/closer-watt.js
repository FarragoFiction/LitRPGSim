The little robot… ‘watt’ a cute fellow, isn’t he? 

Of course, he can hardly be called a robot anymore. How a being of circuits ends up a ghost is entirely out of my field of study, and I can’t really say I care how it happened. He’s fine. Overly restless, anxious, and eager to please, he’s made himself useful around these parts, and his numbers are nothing to scoff at, either.

The kid is very popular with the new Titled, it seems. Not to dissect the poor rookie, but if I had to guess, it’d be because he’s so pitiful. A sad, little robot in a bathtub, crying out for help. Don’t you just want to… help him? Make him happy, perhaps? Well, just do what he asks, and maybe, just maybe, he won’t feel so lonely anymore.

He was the former Herald for a reason, after all. He asked, or I suppose the Arbiter asked through him, and people did. Like one of those digital pets. They sold millions of toys on that premise. Maybe… ah, don’t you hate it when the best ideas come to you after the fact? That would’ve been a brilliant merchandising effort. Well, there’s always another time.
