Now this one is a case worth talking about. The flower chick, the FAQ author… whatever you wish to call her, is quite the rambunctious one. Bursting with energy, and with… words. So many words that she strings in so many different ways. Communication truly was a blessing and a curse to the living.

I’ll be the first to admit it: I thought she was the least worthwhile of the bunch. And, really, could you blame me? What has she done to earn her place? She failed to write one game guide for as long as the world lasted, and then it ended… truly, the etchings of a Scribe. By the time she’d finished hers, we had published seven official guides, all filled with the most delightful knock-knock jokes the modern consumer could’ve asked for. Really, we had cornered the market. What else could she have contributed, aside from a few bashed-in heads?

But… she understands what work entails, even if her methods are a tad unconventional. The real estate idea… worked. It worked well enough, and perhaps it would be uncouth to not give her that. It is… nice, to have someone who has the drive to reach for higher stratums. Dare I say, I have gotten quite used to her company. The energy is almost… welcome, even. To have someone around who can not just say interesting things, but listen as well, and… other highly irrelevant notes like that.

Okay, this file has gone on for too long. Ending it now.
