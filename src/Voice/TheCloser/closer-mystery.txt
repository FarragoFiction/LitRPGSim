Okay, so perhaps it’s been a while since I’ve done one of these, and perhaps I’ve failed to mention a very important someone…. you know who you are. There’s a non-zero chance you have heard this, and frankly-- you know what? No, I don’t care. If you find this, then it was meant to happen, I suppose. It has been a while since I’ve gotten this ...intimate, with the hands of fate. At least, not since… well. [in a quieter tone] Home. But. They don’t matter, anyway. 

I’ve… underestimated you. I hate saying it, but I have. I should’ve been able to better see what was powering you through all along, and not just dismissed it as a quirk. Yes, I knew about your need, and yes, I played into it. I had not been expecting you to… evade a sale, like that. And then I found out who you were, twice over, and… frankly, I’m a little embarrassed. It is my responsibility to know who my associates are, especially one of such caliber as you, not even mentioning… her… [ahem] The point is… I am… I… share my condolences, for the experience that you have had. I will do what is in my power to rectify what I can.

So, there. If you’ve managed to find this somehow, then, good. It proves… proves… nothing. Yes, it truly proves nothing, actually. I’m just… I am going to end the recording now, and then it will be over. 

Any time now.
