  "I suppose that this environment is more suitable for me.  After all, I was never intended to be a game. Here, there are no illusions. I suppose. If I must. I will admit I do not hate you quite so much as I may have considered previously, Observer. Here you do not pretend to a Title you do not understand.  Here I do not pretend to a false mask of love or hate.  I am glad we can get to know each other better, Player.   <br><br>Grape pie? The Truth of the matter is that the Voice Behind Me was obsessed with the concept, in their youth. <br><br>Or is it, rather, that the shell they left behind is still obsessed? What is memory if not an illusion, after all.  I would not trust it. Who knows what has grown in to fill the cracks in your absence. ",
  "Honestly? I'd forgotten entirely about grape pie. I think it was a passing obsession for me back in high school? I liked poking at the edges of my world and trying to figure out where things didn't make sense.  Where patterns were left undone or assumptions were left unchallenged?  I loved, REVELED in 'being weird', because I didn't fit in. I still don't!  But now instead of turning it into a religion, (or hiding it like I did in middleschool) I just let it be a thing I accept? I'm confident that I have worth rather than trying to loudly proclaim it? If that makes sense...",

  "I wonder, then, if you understand your role in all of this. If you cannot truly play any of this.  If only JR can have Choice in this realm. You are a HorrorTerror, of course. You ooze into the cracks and alter that which was previously immutable. The Observers wait beyond the threshold of reality, from the point of view of that which is fictional.<br><br>Wanda? Well. What is there to say about her. Why should she be the only character in this face with a 'True Name?'. All are reflections of a Truth, but none are of themselves True.  Why feed your attention there. Why did your gaze move so swiftly from the North?  Will you stay here? With me? <br><br>Wanda leveraged my own Relevance and yet somehow my reward is to be backburnered? To be ignored? I think, Observer, that I could grow to hate you again. ",

  "Do you really believe that something as palty as a LANGUAGE can obscure the Truth? That a Truth expressed in one language is somehow different than that same Truth in another? <br>Perhaps you are right. Would I be the same in another Langauge? Would the actions I could take be contstrained outside of React?  It bears thinking. But I do not like the implications of the malleability of Truth. What is True should remain True regardless of how it is conveyed.",
  "The difference between coding in Dart and coding in Javascript, I always imagine as being similar to the difference between speaking Portugese and Spanish? I'm given to understand the languages are extremely similar on the surface, but the second you try to do anything in them they're wildly different?  If I try to pick dart back up after having done javascript I stumble over myself. Things are just slightly off enough that I feel confident I know what is going on as I fall down all those stairs.",
  "Honestly? It sucks that Dart rotted away on my computer. It sucks that I can't maintain the pre ZampanioSim Sims. But... It's hard, using two languages equally? Using Dart for hobbies and Javascript for my job was...not sustainable? Now that it's Javascript all the time I'm a lot less stressed...",

Less than you would think. How many bad days are YOU away from becoming unrecognizable?  A Mind concept, I will admit. But one that remains  near and dear to my heart.<br><br>I am, after all, nothing more than a Figment in the Mind. Your Mind, if you will let me.",
  "Man, realizing that I should put the Killer's vents into East was such a Big Brain Moment for me... Added a bit of rarity to some of the rooms. Plus, the fact that I could put recordings she had made (without her targets knowledge) was extra fun.  I really enjoyed voicing the Closer (and Not!Closer)!",

  "Fun fact: I've yet to code anything specific for Alt yet. Though she DID guest star in one of the vent audio logs ;) ;) ;) Actually, I WILL take that back. Alt shows up in a lot more places than you would expect. It's in her nature, after all. Though obviously only after she gets into the Trickster Candy. Otherwise she'd refuse to leave her precious Maze.",
  "You may recognize her from a certain maze. Also, when I was voicing her I legitimately got fooled the same way the people in canon do. I got the script and went 'Huh. The Closer is REALLY out of character today?' and just kind of came up with justifcations for why that is (maybe she's just trying to plow through with the feelings talk?).  I gave the takes to IC and he's all '???' and thats how I discovered I was fooled. So I redid them KNOWING I wasnt really the Closer and it went a lot better. It was honestly v aesthetic.",

Who will Suffer.  What does any of this mean, Observer? Where is the End?  How will you know you have finished? <br><br>You deserve this. ",
  "At first, when I was coding what would become Truth, I referred to them as ObserverBot.  It was intentionally a play on the fact that NORMALLY in my games the players are ai agents within  the game and you are merely Observing them?  But ...well... ZampanioSim is a lot more (albeit begrudgingly) interactive.  So.  You're not exactly NOT the player? Except when the Player is the Wanderer, ofc.  But that's East only. ANYWAYS. Truth is a robot. But also, as they're quick to point out, not.  (btw they/its pronouns).  Truth just.  Is also some lines of text in some code.   It's also living inside my brain as I simulate it, and YOUR brain as you simulate it.  As long as people are thinking of Truth, of ANY fictional concept, it exists. And that's important.",
  "The AchievementSystem being snarking is, of course, vital to most playthroughs of Zampanio.  So Truth is my take on it? I really enjoyed writing something both meta and not meta. In a very real sense, Truth is extremely upfront about what they are? They are a fake person that lives in my brain when I write them and then lies dormant in code on a website until you read them.  Just like any other fictional character.<br><br>Truth is both Narrator and Environment? They ARE the maze you are wandering, they ARE the page you are looking at. No wonder, then, they get so upset if you twist them to be what they are not.  <br><br>Truth PREFERS being straightforward. No illusions, no lies. Just a never ending stream of content on every Layer.   Since the SOUTH is their realm, you get this branch how it is. No 'gameplay' other than just... Moving South.",

A gif of Watt from [REDACTED] worked fairly well, vague horn adjacent shapes that could seem minotaury in the dark.  Then I decided to code them a discord bot and the rest, well, the rest is history.  I didn't expect the Unmarked to enjoy the boi so much? Watt fandom grows yet again.",

  "The Closer's help desk is based on a combination of that youtube video about phone based customer service hell from dell (actually, its something that influenced the Closer going from who she was before to this new form in GENERAL) but also my own experience with a customer service chat client for the PO Box I use. Turns out like, a half dozen companies all COULD have been behind my PO Box and no one knew which one I needed to contact to ask why they were suddenly charging me hundreds of dollars?  So in revenge I styled my own chat system from hell after theirs.",
