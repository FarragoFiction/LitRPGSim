I based the Magnus Archives opening off that dream avatar game? But once it got in it was more about emphasizing Wanda's obsession and how it helps nothing, and certainly not what they thought was WORTH of their obsession.  It IS still fan fiction though, more Magnus Archives than Zampanio. But I like that it gave me the concept of shortening the Wanderer's name to Wanda.  And from THERE I realized that if they have two names, why not three?  Why not have them be the Creator of the Quotidians, their odin?  Norse gods are ALWAYS changing gender anyways.
