it just works--todd i promise
those are--his troll horns
the robots have--the body pillow
robot--rights
the end is never the end is never--the end is never the end is never
the child of fate--yet lives on
zampanio--bottom text
look closer--the truth is out there
one tells the truth--one always lies
the heart--of the minotaur
there are--no left turns
there is--no spiral
the menu--can close
manmade horrors--beyond your comprehension
this is not--a place of honor
there is nothing--of value here
the debt is paid--i owe you nothing
love like brain death--relaxing in its own way
leave a message--after the tone
you dont belong here--leave
this isnt finished--go away
its a beautiful day--you terrible goose
no viruses here--check virustotal
awoken from my slumber--once again
the child of fate is not here--he left long ago
the faq was real--once
i do not--wish to die
you did it-- you won the videogame
have you ever played--the game
oh so thats--where the music came from
the children are gone--leave
join--the collective
