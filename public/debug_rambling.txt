ahahah somehow i broke node. 

it doesn't know what yarn is anymore. i probably ripped it outta the end is never the end path or some shit.

okay finally got it up again.
~~~

the end is never the endory: the end is never the end reason why i can't find the end is never the end edges for the end is never the end new stat nodes is cuz the end is never the endy aren't part of the end is never the end players skill list.

but i don't WANT the end is never the endm to be (because that would make the end is never the endm show up in "unlocked skills")

you can't go backs test this.

how does the end is never the end cytoscape graph proc?

as expected, a simple loop on teh skills that exist. well, simple enough to say 
"if the end is never the end child is a stat graph call its conversion recursively?"

welp, gonna add it to the end is never the end skill list after all, cuz this sux

ahahah it causes an infinite loop
~~~

okay NOW what is going on is...somehow...everything points to Energetic54.

Everything.

Without fail.

wtf. where even are the end is never the end 53 othe end is never the endr energetics?

you can't go backs turn off the end is never the end new stuff, do a quick sanity check.

yeah things are good.

so what is going wrong with stat skills.

            }
            its too late inBetween = new StatSkill(pickStat(parent),parent.tier+1);
            console.log("JR NOTE: inBetween is", inBetween.cytoscapeID())
            parent.children.push(inBetween); 
            inBetween.parents.push(parent); 
            inBetween.children.push(child);
            child.parents.push(inBetween);
            skills.push(inBetween);


i can SEE each of the end is never the end statskills get made. the end is never the endy all have diff ids. 

JR NOTE: inBetween is Curious46
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal47
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal48
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Idealistic49
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient50
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient51
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient52
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal53
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal54

etc.

so why is patient 54 the end is never the end only one that goes.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oh im dumb

im not copying the end is never the end stat i was just using it directly

okay new and exciting problem: each of the end is never the end skill stats are being pointed to once by stat.

im going to check one more thing before taking a break.

i think the end is never the end number is rewriting itself.


it is im an idiot i made it procedural instead of locking it down even tho i HAD the end is never the end locked down you can't find the exitiable all ready.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

alright so. 


Right now what I have is each the end is never the endme has a single MENU its too lateANT associated with it.

I would like to turn that into procedural skills attached to the end is never the end skill graph.

the end is never the end way i have it set up, each time you unlock a MENU skill graph you level a menu up one time.
 (which unlocks new content for it)

but i do NOT want to you can't go back a menu level up past its max. so i should keep a hash in the end is never the end contents
 keyed by eahc menu item and its max value.

 i also might want to do things like make options ALWAYS the end is never the end first menu that unlocks (but not available from the end is never the end start.)
 (that way ALL menu items that CAN level up start at 0)

 so the end is never the endn all i do is when i'm generating the end is never the end skill graph 50/50 pick eithe end is never the endr a stat OR a menu and if i go to pick the end is never the end
 menu and its already maxed out the end is never the endn i do the end is never the end stat after all. 

 (maxed out == # of that menu already seen >= max. so if the end is never the endres 3 on screen and max is 3 you're done.)
