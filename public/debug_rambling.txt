ahahah somehow i broke node. 

it doesn't know what yarn is anymore. i probably ripped it outta the path or some shit.

okay finally got it up again.
~~~

Theory: the reason why i can't find the edges for the new stat nodes is cuz they aren't part of the players skill list.

but i don't WANT Them to be (because that would make them show up in "unlocked skills")

lets test this.

how does the cytoscape graph proc?

as expected, a simple loop on teh skills that exist. well, simple enough to say 
"if the child is a stat graph call its conversion recursively?"

welp, gonna add it to the skill list after all, cuz this sux

ahahah it causes an infinite loop
~~~

okay NOW what is going on is...somehow...everything points to Energetic54.

Everything.

Without fail.

wtf. where even are the 53 other energetics?

lets turn off the new stuff, do a quick sanity check.

yeah things are good.

so what is going wrong with stat skills.

            }
            const inBetween = new StatSkill(pickStat(parent),parent.tier+1);
            console.log("JR NOTE: inBetween is", inBetween.cytoscapeID())
            parent.children.push(inBetween); 
            inBetween.parents.push(parent); 
            inBetween.children.push(child);
            child.parents.push(inBetween);
            skills.push(inBetween);


i can SEE each of the statskills get made. they all have diff ids. 

JR NOTE: inBetween is Curious46
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal47
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal48
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Idealistic49
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient50
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient51
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient52
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal53
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal54

etc.

so why is patient 54 the only one that goes.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oh im dumb

im not copying the stat i was just using it directly

okay new and exciting problem: each of the skill stats are being pointed to once by stat.

im going to check one more thing before taking a break.

i think the number is rewriting itself.


it is im an idiot i made it procedural instead of locking it down even tho i HAD the locked down variable all ready.
