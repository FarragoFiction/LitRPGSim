ahahah somehow i broke node. 

it doesn't know what yarn is anymore. i probably ripped it outta the path or some shit.

okay finally got it up again.
~~~

Theory: the reason why i can't find the edges for the new stat nodes is cuz they aren't part of the players skill list.

but i don't WANT Them to be (because that would make them show up in "unlocked skills")

lets test this.

how does the cytoscape graph proc?

as expected, a simple loop on teh skills that exist. well, simple enough to say 
"if the child is a stat graph call its conversion recursively?"

welp, gonna add it to the skill list after all, cuz this sux

ahahah it causes an infinite loop
~~~

okay NOW what is going on is...somehow...everything points to Energetic54.

Everything.

Without fail.

wtf. where even are the 53 other energetics?

lets turn off the new stuff, do a quick sanity check.

yeah things are good.

so what is going wrong with stat skills.

            }
            const inBetween = new StatSkill(pickStat(parent),parent.tier+1);
            console.log("JR NOTE: inBetween is", inBetween.cytoscapeID())
            parent.children.push(inBetween); 
            inBetween.parents.push(parent); 
            inBetween.children.push(child);
            child.parents.push(inBetween);
            skills.push(inBetween);


i can SEE each of the statskills get made. they all have diff ids. 

JR NOTE: inBetween is Curious46
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal47
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal48
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Idealistic49
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient50
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient51
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Patient52
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal53
BonesFirstAlg.tsx:26 JR NOTE: inBetween is Loyal54

etc.

so why is patient 54 the only one that goes.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oh im dumb

im not copying the stat i was just using it directly

okay new and exciting problem: each of the skill stats are being pointed to once by stat.

im going to check one more thing before taking a break.

i think the number is rewriting itself.


it is im an idiot i made it procedural instead of locking it down even tho i HAD the locked down variable all ready.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

alright so. 


Right now what I have is each theme has a single MENU CONSTANT associated with it.

I would like to turn that into procedural skills attached to the skill graph.

the way i have it set up, each time you unlock a MENU skill graph you level a menu up one time.
 (which unlocks new content for it)

but i do NOT want to let a menu level up past its max. so i should keep a hash in the contents
 keyed by eahc menu item and its max value.

 i also might want to do things like make options ALWAYS the first menu that unlocks (but not available from the start.)
 (that way ALL menu items that CAN level up start at 0)

 so then all i do is when i'm generating the skill graph 50/50 pick either a stat OR a menu and if i go to pick the
 menu and its already maxed out then i do the stat after all. 

 (maxed out == # of that menu already seen >= max. so if theres 3 on screen and max is 3 you're done.)
